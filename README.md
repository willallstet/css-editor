Editing Tumblrâ€™s CSS was one of my first software engineering experiences. Now, with years of experience under my belt, I think back to some of the challenges, successes and excitement I experienced during my early days and want to share what I have learned to help newcomers engage with code. As such, I built a Chrome extension that allows users to edit basic CSS on any page. Through experimentation, trial and error, and play, users can explore the most rudimentary level of writing code using this extension. An introductory glimpse into frontend architecture, the project aims to demystify the world of code for beginners. Each property is linked to its corresponding W3 Schools explanation, and errors are highlighted.
